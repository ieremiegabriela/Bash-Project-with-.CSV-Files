# Bash Project with .CSV Files


## Project Overview

The BASH script I developed handles a CSV data series, adds new records with unique IDs, and can remove specific records without affecting the rest.
It also has the capability to sort and limit results based on certain criteria, such as showing the top three students with the highest marks.
